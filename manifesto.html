        <p>
            At the beginning of this term I felt that design was something that I was fairly experienced with.
            I had previously taken courses on proper design principles from high school to college.
            By the end of the term, I realized how little I had previously known.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are several necessary ingredients when creating any form of software with good design (see “Good Design, Bad Design”).
            Two things were missing from what I had previously learned however; the users themselves and the process.
            This course taught me that there is more to design than aesthetic color schemes.
            Good design comes through a detailed design process that is centered on the user.
            This process requires careful attention to detail and is driven through goals.
            The ideal design process that I’ve learned can be summarized in five steps.
        </p>

        <h3>Set an Objective</h3>

        <p>
            Before a sprint can begin, an objective must be set for the project.
            This means that we should determine immediately what we want to gain from our users.
            What problem have we set out to fix? What do we want to make users feel?
            What should users gain from our product? What software or technology should we use to do this?
            These are important questions that should be answered well before any designing is done.
            My teams for Design for Another World and Design for Wellbeing needed to utilize this concept considering how broad the project criteria was.
            A common mistake that I have made before this class on many of my personal projects (iOS apps, websites, etc.) is that I’ll make something for the sake of making it, without thinking about the user.
            This leads to disorganization throughout the sprint due to lack of end goals and a rushed final product as a result.
        </p>

        <h3>Brainstorming and Ideation</h3>

        <p>
            Ideas can be difficult.
            What might seem like a great idea at first can become much more complicated or fall short towards the end of a project.
            What might seem like a bad idea could have many good aspects to it that can be applied elsewhere.
            The next step towards creating a design involves brainstorming.
            It’s best to throw as many ideas on paper as reasonably possible.
            To do this, team members should brainstorm individually and meet to discuss their ideas after.
            Wild or crazy ideas should definitely be discussed.
            Thinking outside the box has helped me in more than one of our classes’ design sprints, especially in Design for Understanding (shown below).
            Once enough possible ideas are obtained, they can be expanded upon and eliminated until one is chosen.

        <h3>User Interface</h3>

        <p>
            The concept of a UI is one of the most overlooked elements in design from my experience.
            Users can interact with an application in dozens of different ways, yet in most projects with poor design this is frequently overlooked.
            The best way to approach this problem is by considering all choices.
            Should a design use haptic feedback?
            Is it best to use a touchscreen?
            What actions are available that can be sensed as input?
            This concept was really taught when I worked on Design for Another World, our virtual reality project.
            This class taught me to consider many of the more unorthodox methods of user interfaces.
            As an iOS developer I can appreciate this considering the different methods of input that the iPhone offers.

        <h3>Data Visualization</h3>

        <p>
            Users tend to have trouble understanding things that aren’t easily visualized.
            As a result, to implement a design that users can understand it is necessary that numerical and continuous data be appropriately visualized.
            Graphics are the best way to do this, but only when they are done well.
            These graphics can always help a design by communicating essential concepts to a user.
            Improper use of graphs and tables however can confuse or frustrate the user (shown below).
            Because of this, it is important to ensure that proper representations of data are created.
            When designing data visualizations, don’t only think about tables and graphs, there are lots of other options too!
            An example are the maps our team made in Design for Understanding.

        <h3>User Feedback</h3>

        <p>
            From what I’ve learned over the past few months, the single most important step towards good design is understanding your user.
            The best way to do this is through constant feedback.
            When looking for feedback from users it's usually best to establish what about a certain design is “good” and what “needs improvement.”
            Surveys or interviews can be done to obtain this information.
            A tool that we used in class for feedback is demo day.
            By presenting the current state of your sprint you can get outside feedback that will almost always give a perspective that you may not have considered.
            Once feedback is obtained, certain concepts can be added, changed, expanded upon, or removed from the final iteration of a design.
