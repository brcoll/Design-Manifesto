# Design Manifesto and Final Project

This project contains a final portfolio and post that acts to synthesize and reflects on all of the work accomplished throughout the term. This website contains two elements:

* A portfolio display that visually shows projects and links to corresponding Medium blog posts
* A Design Manifesto which reflects on the class and how it has impacted design philosophy.

A tab bar is used to shift between section of this website.

## Portfolio

This section is created through through two rows of three projects.
Each project maintains visual similarity and contains:

1. An image pertaining to the project
2. A link to the Medium post
3. A brief description of the project
4. A website link to the project itself if one exists
 

## Manifesto

This section is a more detailed read on how my design philosophy has changed over the course of this class.
Rationale is given and the six projects are referenced to further explanation.
